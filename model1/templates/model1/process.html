      <br>
      <p>In this data set, there are 301 types of businesses available in Las Vegas. Our group decided to use a word cloud that allows us to map the most popular businesses.

      <br>
    <p>In order to help users pick the most popular places to go, our group selected the top 50 business types and conduct user testings to determine top 8. Below graph shows the percentage of all business types for 8 selected by targeted users.</p>

      <h2 class='green-text'>Machine Learning</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Our website uses Collaborative Filtering machine learning algorithm to recommend 5 businesses for users. Collaborative filtering(CF) is a typical way of using collective wisdom, is commonly applied in business. The first version of CF is developed by solving the email problem. It is now widely applied on e-commercials so that it can offer users and customers their potential preference. The data is collected from user’s historical behavior, such as the user's purchase history, collection behavior, or published some comments. In CF, the recommendation algorithm is designed to calculate the user and the similarity between items by Euclidean distance or Cosine similarity. In our project, we collect the user’s rating on different bars and clubs. Then we calculate the rating matrix and it’s matrix decomposition and get the rating on the businesses which are not scored. Our recommendation categories include bars, dance clubs, casinos, and pubs. This method helps our user to find their potential favorites from our recommendation system.
